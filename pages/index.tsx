              Retailers say organized theft is biting into profits,
            </RetailersSayOrganized>
            <RetailersSayOrganized>
              but internal issues may really be to blame

          </RetailersSayOrganizedContainer>
          <RetailersWhoBlame>
            Retailers who blame organized theft for lower profits could be
            overstating crime’s impact to cover up internal flaws or
            self-inflicted problems, CNBC has learned. But behind closed doors,
            retailers are facing other issues they can better control, including
            theft by their own employees, that are contributing to losses,
            according to two sources who advise major retailers.

            Inevitably, anything that adds friction to the buying process, i.e.,
            making the customer experience more difficult or more effortful,
            will reduce sales. The negative impact may be as high as 15 to 25%.
            Some sales may be pushed to other channels, like curbside pickup or
            home delivery. In the most optimistic case, these online sales still
            accrue to Target If a customer always buys the same product, locked
            cases are merely an inconvenience. If a customer wants to compare
            brands, read labels, etc. locked cases are an insurmountable
            barrier.
